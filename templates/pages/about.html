        <h3>School</h3>
        <p>I am a 4th year computer science student at the University of Toronto with a interest in mathematics, 
            artificial intelligence and natural language proccessing. Through school I have experience with python, 
            java, and c, using my knowledge to create programs such as a job scheduler, file system, and algorithms to solve problems.
            Having learnt not only about programming but also about the mathematics behind the algroithms we create I have experience 
            creating algorithms and data structures to be efficient. 
        </p>
        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>I have worked on many personal projects and through that have gained lots of experience with python (flask), javascript (including frameworks such as vue, 
            react), and kotlin. I have advanced experience with go, sql and lua, and little experience with rust. I have created multiple versions of my personal website
            improving with each version. I have also created a project tracking web app originally made with a rest api made with flask and a web frontend made with vue js,
            recently I created a new version of the application; upgrading the rest api to be made in the language go making it considerably faster, and creating a mobile app
            version using kotlin allowing for use of more native features. These projects can be seen in the project page.
        </p>
        <h3>Work</h3>
        <p>For the last 3 years I have been working as a server at a Boston Pizze, this has taught me alot of soft skills such as problem solving and leadership.
            Working as a server you must be adaptable and able to solve problems as they arise to ensure the guest have the best experience at your restraunt, many
            problems can occour such as the food not being up to par, a poorley made drink, or even a customer being too loud all while dealing with other customers. 
            To deal with these issues I have learnt to think critically and to come up with solutions quickly as well as how to communicate my solutions to all parties,
            all skills which will help me not only in the workplace but also in my personal life.
        </p>
        <h2>Personal vision</h2>
        <p>My goal is to learn more and to improve how computers interact with humans. I wish to be on the forefront of research in human-computer interaction, 
            including emerging technologies such as augmented reality (ar) and furthering the research into heavily studied fields such as natural language
            proccessing. Through my knowledge of mathematics and technology I wish to help create a program/device which can help humans better
            communicate with the machine. I imagine a future whwere humans and machines become very interconnected and one of the most crucial steps needed is to
            better our ability to "talk" to the machines.
